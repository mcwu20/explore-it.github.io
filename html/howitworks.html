		<h2>How does a hang glider work?</h2>
		<p>Let's start with a few important parts of a hang glider!</p>
		
		<img id="parts" src="../images/hang-gliding-parts.gif" alt="diagram">
		
		<ul id="info">
			<li>The <span style=color:white;>sail</span> is what people see from the ground, which is the colorful fabric.</li> 
			<li>The hang glider has <span style=color:white;>tubes</span> which make and support the triangle shape.</li>
			<li>There are also steel <span style=color:white;>wires</span> that help support the weight and stresses on a hang glider.</li>
			<li>The <span style=color:white;>control bar</span> is the bar that you would need to hold onto when gliding.</li> 
			<li>The <span style=color:white;>harness</span>, which attaches to the center of the hang glider, holds us up in the air. It's kind of like a seatbelt.</li>
			
		</ul>
		<p>To hang glide, you need have something to create a lift off. Most people start from some place high, like hills! But you can also be lifted on flat ground through something called winches.</p>
		<p>If starting from a hill, we will have to run to gain speed. Remember to hold on tight!</p>
		<p>Now, the next big question.</p>
		<h2> How do we control the hang glider in the air?</h2>
		<p>To move left and right, we will need to shift our weight. Lean towards the left and we will move left. Lean towards the right and we will move right.</p>
		<img src="../images/glider_moving.gif" alt="moving glider">
		<p>To move forward and backward, we will have to move the control bar. By pulling the bar towards us, we can move backwards. By pushing the bar away from us, we can move forward.</p>
